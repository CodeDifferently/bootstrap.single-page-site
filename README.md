## Git Collaboration Strategy

#### Part 1 - Assigning an origin-owner
1. Assign one person to _fork_ the original repository. This will be the _origin-owner_.
2. The _origin-owner_ should add each of the group-members as a _contributor_ to the project.
3. Each group-member should then _clone_ the project from their _origin-owner_


#### Part 2 - Pushing your first change
1. As each of you complete a different part of the application, ensure that you are _pushing_ your changes.
	* _changes_ can be _pushed_ by executing the following commands.
		1. `git add .`
		2. `git commit -m 'update message'`
		3. `git push -u origin master` 


#### Part 3 - Pulling your first change
* You can keep in sync by executing the following commands
	1. `git pull origin master`
	2. `git add .`
	3. `git commit -m 'merged with master'`
	4. `git push -u origin master`

#### Part 4 - Publish the project online
1. Navigate to the _settings_ tab of the repository.
2. Scroll down until you see `GitHub Pages` section
3. Select `Use the master branch for Github Pages`
4. Scroll down until you see `Your site is published at ...`
5. Copy the link associated with your site.
6. Navigate to your repository.
7. Edit the description of your respotory by adding a link to the site.
